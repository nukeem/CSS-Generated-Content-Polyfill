CSS Generated Content Polyfill
========================

A polyfill for browsers that dont support CSS Generated Content (:before, :after).

Currently very basic 
Mainly aimed at IE7 & 8,
Currently relies on jQuery,
Runs its own test before running so it just has to be included on your page. 
Tested in IE7 & IE8
