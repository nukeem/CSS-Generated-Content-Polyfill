CSS Generated Content Polyfill
========================

A polyfill for browsers that dont support CSS Generated Content (:before, :after).

Currently very basic <br />
Mainly aimed at IE7 & 8,<br />
Currently relies on jQuery,<br />
Runs its own test before running so it just has to be included on your page. <br />
Tested in IE7 & IE8<br />
